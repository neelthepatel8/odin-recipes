        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love the unique and delicate flavor of truffles. This recipe highlights the truffle flavor in a creamy texture spread. The appetizer will fill your home with a lovely aroma and presents well on a platter. Mushroom lovers beware! This appetizer spread can be made ahead and stored in the fridge until you are ready to for your guests.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup black truffle-infused olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package crimini mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>¼ cup diced red bell pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup minced flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ large baguette, sliced into thin rounds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons truffle-infused oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add red bell pepper, parsley, and garlic to mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms are golden and lightly browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat.

            </li>
            <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.

            </li>
            <li>Stir remaining truffle-infused oil and cream cheese into mushroom mixture until cheese melts from the heat of the skillet; season with salt and pepper. Spread mushroom-cheese mixture onto each baguette round. Arrange rounds on a baking sheet.

            </li>
            <li>Broil bruschetta until bread is warmed, 2 to 3 minutes.

            </li>
        </ol>
